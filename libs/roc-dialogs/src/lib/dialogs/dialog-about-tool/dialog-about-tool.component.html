      Return On College (ROC) is the first tool of its kind and the most comprehensive return-on-investement calculator for
      college and career pathways. ROC uses the most up-to-date information from education and workforce agencies to
      develop the most accurate and individualized picture of your future. With support from the
      U.S. Department of Education, ROC was built over three years by a team of application developers,
      data scientists, and education researchers with deep expertise in modeling education and career options.

    <p class="font-sans text-sm text-justify text-gray-400">
      You might follow one of two pathways after high school: 1. Go to work (or stay at work if you already have a job)
      or 2. Go to college and then to work. ROC compares these pathways for you - from high school graduation through
      retirement - to show which may leave you with the most money in your pocket in the end. Going to work
      immediately helps you earn money faster, but, while going to collge has costs(e.g, tuition), college
      graduates typically earn more than those with a high school diploma, so you might earn more in the
      long run. ROC takes all of this into account by using your specific location, career interests,
      and college choices.

      <p class="font-sans text-sm text-justify text-gray-400">
        In the first pathway, we take your location and intended or current job with your high school diploma and
        project your earnings potential and increase your earnings over time with inflation and other adjustments.
        We also consider your costs of living (e.g., rent, food, entertainment) before calculating your lifetime
        earnings with a high school diploma.

        In the second pathway, we guide you through selecting a college, a degree, and a major.
        We also use the most up-to-date information on costs to show how much you could expect
        to pay for a degree (e.g., tuition, room and board, and any supplies) and let you enter
        or estimate your financial aid and scholarships. We then project your lifetime earnings
        with a college degree and take into account the same factors (e.g., inflation, living expenses)
        plus any other costs you might pay - such as if you borrowed and need to repay a loan.

      If your college benefit is positive, completing a degree would be a good financial decision for you.

    <p class="font-sans text-sm text-justify text-gray-400">
      For your college pathway, we also compute your return on investement (ROI). The ROI helps you understand
      the value you got out of completing a degree relative to what it cost you. ROC computes this for you.

      <p class="font-sans text-sm text-justify text-gray-400">
        If you earn $20,000 more per year with a college degree and paid $5,000 per year for college,
        your ROI would be 300%, an excellent return!

        These calculations are the core of ROC, but so many other features are available to you! ROC also
        allows you to compare different colleges and majors to see which might have the highest payoff;
        lets you explore different locations to see where your degree might hold the most value; and helps
        you consider different ways of paying for college to reduce your total costs.
